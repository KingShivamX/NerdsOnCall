# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix the WebSocket connection issues occurring on the tutor side of the application. Currently, WebSocket connections to 'ws://localhost:8080/socket.io/' are failing, preventing proper communication between tutors and the server. This feature will ensure that tutors can establish and maintain stable WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tutor, I want to establish a stable WebSocket connection with the server, so that I can communicate in real-time with students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tutor accesses the application THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the correct server endpoint.
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain the connection until the tutor leaves the application.
3. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically.
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL log a successful connection message.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tutor, I want the WebSocket configuration to be consistent across the application, so that all WebSocket-dependent features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use a consistent WebSocket configuration across all components.
2. IF the WebSocket endpoint needs to be different in different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment variables to configure the endpoint.
3. WHEN the WebSocket configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply the changes consistently across all components that use WebSockets.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling for WebSocket connections, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information.
2. WHEN a WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user.
3. IF the WebSocket connection cannot be established after multiple attempts THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to resolve the issue.
